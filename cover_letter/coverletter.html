        <p>To the editors of Science:</p>
        <p>We submit for your review: “The role of the microbiome in health and disease” by Geoffrey Hannigan and colleagues. We believe this work to be especially well suited for publication in Science and highly relevant to a broader scientific readership as well as the general public.</p>
        <p>Our lab strives to set high standards of reproducibility and transparency, while generating and publishing high quality data. As such, all analysis work-flows, scripts, and datasets have been made publicly available for other researchers to utilize.</p>
        <p>The data presented in this manuscript are original and the manuscript is not under consideration elsewhere. A preprint version of this manuscript has been made available through BioRxiv.</p>
        <p>We thank you for your consideration and look forward to your response.</p>
